# Tiny Foundation Models
This repository offers a list of tiny foundation models, fully compatible with their larger counterparts. It is useful to accelerate experimentation and rapid iteration in model/codebase development.

This collection primarily features models contributed by the community, complemented by a few models I personally trained.
